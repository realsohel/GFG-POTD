// New Year Resolution


// As the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, Geek bid farewell to the wasted moments of 2023, realizing the untapped potential of GFG's Problem of the Day.

// His 2024 resolution: Solve POTD every day.

// Eager to earn coins for GFG Merchandise, Geek faces new rules:

// Earning Coin: Geek can accumulate coins[i] by solving the POTD on the ith day, where 1 <= coins[i] <= 2024 and the sum of coins <= 2024.
// Merchandise Eligibility: To purchase merchandise, the coins earned must be divisible by 20 or 24, or precisely equal to 2024.
// Geek's resolutions often fades over time. Realistically, he can only commit to active participation for N (where N â‰¤ 366) days. Given the value of N and number of coins associated with each POTD, can Geek strategically solve some (or all) POTDs to become eligible for redeeming merchandise?
