//  Question: K Closest Points to Origin
// Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
// The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
// You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

// Answer: The solution is to use a min heap. The algorithm is as follows
// 1. Create a min heap.
// 2. Insert all the elements of the array into the min heap.
// 3. Pop the top element of the min heap k times and store it in a vector.
// 4. The vector contains the k closest elements to the origin.
// 5. The time complexity of the solution is O(N*logK) where N is the number of elements in the array.
// 6. The space complexity of the solution is O(K) where K is the number of closest elements to be found.
