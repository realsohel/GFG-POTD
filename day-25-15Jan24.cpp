// Grinding Geek
// GeeksforGeeks has introduced a special offer where you can enroll in any course, and if you manage to complete 90% of the course within 90 days, you will receive a refund of 90%.

// Geek was fascinated by this offer. This offer was valid for only n days, and each day a new course was available for purchase. Geek decided that if he bought a course on some day, he will complete that course on the same day itself and redeem floor[90% of cost of the course] amount back. Find the maximum number of courses that Geek can complete in those n days if he had total amount initially.

// Note: On any day, Geek can only buy the new course that was made available for purchase that day.
